# ML Zoomcamp 2025 - Homework 2

This repository contains my solution to the second homework assignment from the Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025 course.

## Contents

- `02-regression.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with solutions to all 6 homework questions
- `car_fuel_efficiency.csv` - Dataset used for the analysis

## Questions Covered

1. **Missing Values** - Identify which column has missing values
2. **Median Horsepower** - Find the median value of the horsepower column
3. **Missing Value Strategy** - Compare RMSE when filling missing values with 0 vs mean
4. **Regularization Parameter** - Find the best regularization parameter for Ridge regression
5. **Model Stability** - Assess model stability across different random seeds
6. **Final Model Performance** - Evaluate final model with combined train+validation data

## Dataset

The homework uses the car fuel efficiency dataset:
